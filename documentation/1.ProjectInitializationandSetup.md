1. **Project Initialization**:
   - we cloned a boilerplate from, https://github.com/abundis29/rn-mobile
   - remove everything that is not needed. 
   - Ensure that the project directory structure is in place, including essential folders such as `src`, `__tests__`, and configuration files. âœ…

2. **Package Files**:
   - First time npm install then we create a script to manage the next runs and installations with npm ci, to do a clean installation from package-lock.json
   - Here is a list why we need all of the next dependencies in project.json

3. **Expo Configuration** (if using Expo):
   - Include the `app.json` file with initial configuration settings for your Expo project.

4. **Git Configuration**:
   - Initialize a Git repository in the project folder using `git init`.
   - Create a `.gitignore` file to specify which files or directories should be ignored by Git. Ensure it includes typical entries for node_modules, build artifacts, and sensitive information (e.g., API keys).

5. **Initial Directory Structure**:
   - Create the initial directory structure as mentioned in the project design document. go to README.md
   - Commit the base structure, even if some directories are empty at this stage. use, touch foldername/.gitkeep
