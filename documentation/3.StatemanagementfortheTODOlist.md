**Why Redux and Related Tools**:

Redux is chosen for state management in this application because it provides a predictable and centralized way to manage application state. It offers a structured approach to handling data flow, making it easier to maintain and scale the app.

- **Redux**: Offers a single source of truth for application state, which simplifies debugging and data consistency.

- **Redux Toolkit**: Provides a set of tools and patterns to streamline Redux development, reducing boilerplate code.

- **Redux Persist**: Enables data persistence, allowing the app to retain state across sessions, which is crucial for user data and preferences.

- **Async Storage**: Used for efficient storage of persisted state, ensuring data is available even after app restarts.

These tools work in harmony to create a reliable and efficient state management system that improves the application's maintainability and user experience.

STEPS:

1. **Define the State**: Create interfaces for the state and data structures, such as `Todo` and `TodoState`, to represent the app's data.
    -src/reducers/todoReducer.ts

2. **Create a Redux Slice**: Utilize `createSlice` from Redux Toolkit to create a Redux slice. This defines the state structure and reducers.
    - src/reducers
        -src/reducers/todoReducer.ts

3. **Add Reducers**: Implement reducer functions for adding, updating, deleting, and toggling todos. These functions modify the state according to the dispatched actions.
    - src/reducers/todoReducer.ts

4. **Configure the Store**: Set up the Redux store by configuring it with the combined reducer and middleware. Use `configureStore` and middleware, like `redux-persist`, to enhance store capabilities.
    - src/store/store.ts

5. **Persist State**: Integrate `redux-persist` to store specific parts of the state persistently. In this app, the `todos` state is chosen for persistence.
    - src/store/store.ts

6. **Export Store and Hooks**: Export the configured Redux store and provide custom hooks, like `useAppDispatch` and `useAppSelector`, to access the store and dispatch actions from components.
    - src/store/store.ts
Here's a folder structure that organizes the Redux-related code according to the steps you mentioned:


In this structure:

- `app/` contains the main `App.tsx` file, where you wrap your app with the Redux `Provider`.
- `components/` includes components like `TodoList` and `TodoItem` that utilize the Redux store.
- `reducers/` is where you define your Redux slices, such as `todoSlice.ts`.
- `store/` contains the Redux store configuration in `store.ts`.
- `types/` defines TypeScript interfaces for `Todo.ts` and `TodoState.ts`.
- `utils/` includes utility files, like `persistConfig.ts`, for configuring state persistence.
- `hooks/` contains custom hooks like `useAppDispatch.ts` and `useAppSelector.ts` to access the Redux store.
- `__tests__/` is where you place unit tests, such as `todoSlice.test.ts`, for your Redux slice and related functions.
- `index.tsx` serves as the entry point for your app.

This folder structure separates different aspects of your Redux implementation for better organization and maintainability.
