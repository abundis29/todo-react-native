## 1. Project Structure

The project follows a structured organization to maintain code quality and architecture pattern. Below is an overview of the folder structure:

## 2. Authentication Process

The primary authentication method in this single-user application is biometric authentication using the `expo-local-authentication` module. The app requires the user to authenticate via fingerprint or face recognition to gain access.
