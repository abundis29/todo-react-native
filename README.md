2. **Efficient Task Management**: Develop a user-friendly and efficient UI/UX for the TODO list, allowing users to add, update, and delete tasks with eabse.
3. **Structured State Management**: Implement clean and robust state management using Redux to centralize and manage the application's state.
4. **Code Reliability**: Utilize TypeScript for strong typing, enhancing code reliability and maintainability.
5. **Testing for Quality Assurance**: Write unit tests to cover critical application parts, including authentication, state management, and essential functionality.
6. **Seamless Integrations**: Demonstrate familiarity with Expo and its modules, integrating them for a polished user experience.
7. **Third-Party Compatibility**: Show the ability to integrate third-party libraries or native code where necessary to enhance the application's functionality.
8. **Logical Problem Solving**: Approach the project systematically, breaking down requirements, choosing the right architecture, and ensuring user-friendly UI/UX.
9. **Structured Codebase**: Maintain high code quality by following best practices in coding standards, file structure, and separation of concerns.
10. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Provide comprehensive comments and documentation to explain complex logic, authentication flow, state management, and styling.
11. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Develop the application for both iOS and Android platforms to reach a wider audience.
12. **Smooth Navigation**: Ensure smooth transitions between authentication and TODO list screens using React Navigation.
13. **Maintainable Styling**: Employ Styled Components to simplify styling, contributing to a maintainable and structured codebase.
14. **Adherence to Store Requirements**: Properly configure the project with essential files (e.g., `package.json` and `app.json`) to ensure compliance with App Store and Play Store requirements.

### What

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ __tests__/
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ app.json
â”œâ”€â”€ ... (other configuration files)
```

## Authentication and Authorization

### Authentication Flow

- We implement local authentication using Expo's local-authentication module.
- Users are required to authenticate before accessing any Todo features.
- Authentication methods include biometric authentication (fingerprint, face ID), and PIN codes.

### Authorization

- Robust state management controls access to the Todo list based on authentication status.

## Todo List Features

### UI/UX

- The UI/UX focuses on simplicity and user-friendliness, aligning with App Store and Play Store standards.
- Expo modules enhance the user experience.
- A `TodoList.tsx` component efficiently manages tasks with an intuitive interface.
- Expo's `List` component is employed for a polished UI.

### State Management

- Clean and robust state management is achieved using React Native's built-in state management.
- TypeScript adds strong typing, ensuring code reliability and maintainability.

### Unit Tests

- Critical parts of the application are covered by unit tests, utilizing the Jest testing framework.
- Testing focuses on key functions, components, and authentication methods.

### Third-party Integrations

- Native code integrations are demonstrated where necessary.
- Third-party libraries are seamlessly integrated.

## Styling

### Styled Components

- Styled Components simplify styling, contributing to maintainable and structured code.
- Style definitions are organized in separate files, such as `AuthenticationStyles.ts` and `TodoListStyles.ts`.

## Code Quality and Documentation

- The project adheres to high standards for code quality and architecture patterns.
- Comprehensive comments and documentation explain complex logic, authentication flow, state management, and styling.
- Code maintains a balance between simplicity and structure for ease of review and maintenance.



## Project Setup

### Configuration

- The project is properly configured with essential files like `package.json` and `app.json`, ensuring compliance with the App Store and Play Store requirements.

## Installation ðŸ› 

[![CI](https://github.com/abundis29/todo-react-native/actions/workflows/node.js.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/abundis29/todo-react-native/actions/workflows/node.js.yml)

Before you begin, ensure you have the following dependencies:

- iOS: Xcode or developer tools
- Android: Android Studio

### Running the Setup

In case of a setup failure on the first attempt, execute the setup command twice:

```bash
npm run setup
```

## Development Specifications

### Task Description & Approach



#### Create the Application Structure

- Establish a bare React Native project with a well-structured directory, including components, screens, navigation, utilities, and tests.

[User Stories](documentation/todo.md)

#### Expo Local Authentication Implementation

- In the `hooks/useBiometricAuthentication` directory, we've created an `useBiometricAuthentication.ts` file to implement local authentication.

This project demonstrates the candidate's expertise in building a secure, user-friendly mobile application with a strong focus on code quality, architecture patterns, and problem-solving.
